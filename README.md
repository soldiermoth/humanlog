Read logs from `stdin` and prints them back to `stdout`, but prettier.

forked from https://github.com/aybabtme/humanlog

# Using it

[Grab a release](https://github.com/soldiermoth/humanlog/releases) or :

## With Go installed
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/soldiermoth/humanlog/...
```

## On linux

```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/soldiermoth/humanlog/releases/download/0.1.16/humanlog_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xvz
```

# Example

If you emit logs in JSON or in [`logfmt`](https://brandur.org/logfmt), you will enjoy pretty logs when those
entries are encountered by `humanlog`. Unrecognized lines are left unchanged.

```
$ humanlog < /var/log/logfile.log
```

# Contributing

How to help:

* __support more log formats__: by submitting `human.Handler` implementations.
* __live querying__: add support for filtering in log output in real time.
* __charting__: some key-values have semantics that could be charted in real time. For
instance, durations, frequency of numeric values, etc. See the [l2met][] project.
